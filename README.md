The code in this repository was made for the course Autonomous Systems in Instituto Superior Tecnico.
It was made on top of the simulation developed by ISR (Instituto Superior de Robotica) and can be downloaded in this link.

The Ubunto version used was 16.04 and ROS Kinetic. Follow the steps to install both using this links:

The code we developed is a SLAM algorithm based on Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and uses Arucu Markers for the mapping algorithm. The code was validated by comparison using the gmapping algorithm as the standard.
